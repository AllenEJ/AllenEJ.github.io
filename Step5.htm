    <h2>Commit to master and publish on the web</h2>
    
    <p> Your repository will now look something like this:</p>
    
    
   <center><img src="assets/Screen%20Shot%202019-03-14%20at%2013.25.25.png" width=80% alt=repository></center>
    
  <p>You can now publish your files. To do this, make sure that all files are selected by clicking the tick box at top left of the changes pane. Then select 'commit to master' at bottom left:</p>
    
    <center><img src="assets/commit.png" width=80% alt='commit'></center>

    
    <p>Now select the 'publish repository' button at the top of the window</p>
   
    <center><img src="assets/Screen%20Shot%202019-03-14%20at%2013.52.00.png" width=40% alt="publish"></center>
        
    <p> Another dialogue box will now open. Make sure that you give the site a descriptive name and ensure that the 'keep this code private' box is unticked (this allows your site to be shared):</p>
    
    <center><img src="assets/Screen%20Shot%202019-03-14%20at%2013.55.07.png" width=50% alt=publishfiles></center>
    
    <p>Your file is now on the web! Use the URL in your blog to share with your tutors</p>
    
    <p><strong>Note:</strong>if you need to make any changes to your files just upload the changed files to your github repository and then commit to master and this should make the changes.</p>
